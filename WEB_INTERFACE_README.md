## How to Use

### 1. Start the System
```bash
npm start
```

The web interface will automatically start when you run the main arbitrage system.

### 2. Access the Dashboard
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Monitor Real-time Data
- The dashboard will automatically connect to the trading system
- All data updates in real-time as the system processes trades
- Connection status is shown at the top of the page
- Last update timestamp is displayed at the bottom

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: HTML5 with CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for instant data transmission
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Data Flow
1. Trading system processes arbitrage opportunities
2. When data changes, the system broadcasts updates via WebSocket
3. Web interface receives updates and refreshes the display
4. Users see real-time updates without page refresh

### Files Structure
```
├── web_interface.js          # Web server and Socket.IO setup
├── public/
│   └── index.html           # Main dashboard HTML file
├── test_web_interface.js    # Test script for web interface
└── WEB_INTERFACE_README.md  # This documentation
```

## Testing

To test the web interface independently:

```bash
node test_web_interface.js
```

This will start only the web interface without the trading system for testing purposes.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is already in use, you can modify the port in `web_interface.js`:

```javascript
this.port = 3001; // Change to any available port
```

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the trading system is running
- Check that port 3000 is not blocked by firewall
- Verify that Socket.IO client library is loading correctly

### Data Not Updating
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify that the trading system is actively processing data
- Ensure the WebSocket connection is established (green indicator)

## Browser Compatibility

The web interface is compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Security Notes

- The web interface is designed for local monitoring only
- No authentication is implemented (for development use)
- Consider implementing security measures for production deployment
- The interface only displays data and does not allow trading control

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the web interface:
- Add authentication system
- Implement trading controls (start/stop trading)
- Add historical data charts
- Include more detailed exchange information
- Add alert notifications
- Implement dark/light theme toggle
